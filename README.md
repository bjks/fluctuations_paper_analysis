# Sources of protein concentration fluctuations

Notebooks and scripts for the publication _"Single-cell growth rate fluctuations contribute independently from protein production to gene expression noise and decrease with average growth rate"_

Note that the scripts for plotting in `nb_noise_courses_figs` rely on the simulations and integration scripts provided in `simulations`
